->Printing - Many variables at a time console.log([variable1,variable2,variable3]);
->Object type  of null is object;
->we use `${}` for Printing
->In array functions, {arr.slice()  =>> Array doesn't get modified} , While in {arr.splice =>> Array get modified}
-> Array concatanation =>> 1. [...arr1,...arr2] Normal concatanation of two arrays   2.If we have to cancatanate the array inside the array inside array we use arr.flat(number of inside arrays) method         
->Objects =>> 1. Keys are considered as strings, 2.Symbols are declared as {[mySymbol]:"hi"} 3. Instead of using .(dot) operator in some situations we can use console.log(user[variable1]) also  3. We can make the object unchangeable by Object.freeze(object name);
->Objects inside objects can be accessed by using (.) dot operator 
->To merge the objects like Arrays, we use Objects.assign(), ({},obj1,obj2...) We use {} so that the objects get merged easily and looks more professional but not necessarily imp
->But the easiest way to merge the object is just like the arrays {...obj1,...obj2} 
->By object.keys(), we can  convert the object into the arrays And also use Object.values() to get their respective values 
->Destructuring of an Object in JS means changing its POV of calling means JavaScript.user will become user or myuser whatever easy name you want to give instead of typing JavaScript. every time 
->For above concept, fun({destructured object}), curly braces are used 
-> JSON(JavaScript object notation) is for APIs(APIs handle the task of others)
-> Functions : function hello(){}, this is how the functions are being written 
-> hello, this is the referance, while hello(), this is the execution of the function.
-> In any function, if argument remains empty, automatically return undefined not null.
->If in any function we have given one argument but i have to return more number of values then we use (...variableName) in function itself while passing the argument 
-> The above mentioned (...) is called REST operator {Previously used as spread operator for merging the arrays}.
-> If in above argument we pass (var1,var2,...num1), and pass 10 values in function then first two values will be assigned to the given two varibales(i.e. var1 and var2) and all the others will be then assigned by REST operator as mentioned above.
-> If any function being stored in any variable, it will be sometimes called Expression and if we call the variablein which it is stored above where it is written it will give me error because it was stored in a variable .
-> this Keyword is used to refer to current context means for ex. in this codeblock only, means when you will change the value of the variable, it will change
-> In Browser everything is stored under window object, So value for this in browser comes out to be under Window while in VS(node) it came out as {} - empty
-> In Arrow Function, If we wrap the values in {} we have to write return keyword, Else we don't need to write the return keyword
-> Brackets are usually used in these cases and they are mostly used in React 
-> IIFE(Immediately Invoked function Expression) used to remove the pollution caused by global scope variable And IIFE is invoked Immediately.
-> We wrap the function and next line which we want to execute like this ()().
-> Always use ; Semicolon in IIFE that tells it where to stop
