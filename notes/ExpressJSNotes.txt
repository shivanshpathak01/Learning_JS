                  Library vs Framework 
-> Library : A library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks.
-> Full control in our hands in using the Library

-> Framework : A Framework is a set of pre-written code that provides a structure for developing software Applications.
-> Fully controlled by Frameworks

*********    Express.js    ***********
-> A Node.js web Application Framework that helps us to make the web applications .
-> It is used for server side Programming.

We use Express because It: 
1. listens for incoming Request 
2. parse the Request 
3. matches the response with the routes (for ex : google.com/search, Here search is a route , things after the '/' )
4. Give suitable Response back to the request made.
